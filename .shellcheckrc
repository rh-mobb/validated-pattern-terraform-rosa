# ShellCheck configuration file
# See https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034 for directive documentation

# Exclude common warnings that may be acceptable in this project
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location.
# SC1091: Not following: (error message here)
# These are common when sourcing files dynamically

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# We'll enforce this, but some scripts may intentionally use unquoted variables

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Some scripts may intentionally combine declaration and assignment

# Note: Individual scripts can override these with shellcheck directives
# Example: # shellcheck disable=SC2086
