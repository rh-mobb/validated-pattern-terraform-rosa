# CloudWatch Audit Log Forwarding Configuration
# Reference: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7002219
# This configuration configures the cluster to forward audit logs to CloudWatch.
# The IAM role and policy are created in the IAM module.
#
# NOTE: The IAM role ARN is provided via cloudwatch_audit_logging_role_arn variable (from IAM module output)

# Configure audit log forwarding on the cluster using ROSA CLI
# Using script-based approach until audit_log_arn is available in official provider release
# Once PR is accepted, we can switch to provider-native implementation in 10-main.tf
# Reference: ./reference/rosa-hcp-dedicated-vpc/terraform/5.siem-logging.tf
