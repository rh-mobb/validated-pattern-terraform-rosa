# CloudWatch Audit Log Forwarding IAM Configuration
# Reference: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7002219
# This configuration creates an IAM role and policy for CloudWatch audit log forwarding.
# The role uses OIDC federation to allow the OpenShift audit log exporter service account to assume the role.
#
# IMPORTANT: The OIDC endpoint URL must NOT include the "https://" prefix when used in IAM trust policies.
# Reference: Red Hat documentation shows stripping https:// from the OIDC endpoint URL
#
# NOTE: If you see a "Provider produced inconsistent final plan" error from the time provider in the
# oidc_config_and_provider module, this is a known issue where the upstream module's time_sleep resource
# sees the OIDC endpoint URL format change. This typically resolves on the next apply. The normalization
# here only affects our IAM trust policy and does not modify the upstream module's behavior.

# IAM Policy for CloudWatch Logging
# Grants permissions to create log groups, log streams, and write log events to CloudWatch
