# CloudWatch Logging for OpenShift Logging Operator
# Reference: ./reference/pfoster/rosa-hcp-dedicated-vpc/terraform/4.logging.tf
# This configuration creates an IAM role and policy for the OpenShift Logging Operator to send logs to CloudWatch.
# The role uses OIDC federation to allow the OpenShift Logging Operator service account to assume the role.
#
# IMPORTANT: The OIDC endpoint URL must NOT include the "https://" prefix when used in IAM trust policies.
# Reference: Red Hat documentation shows stripping https:// from the OIDC endpoint URL
#
# NOTE: This is separate from audit logging (SIEM) which uses openshift-config-managed:cloudwatch-audit-exporter
# This role is for the OpenShift Logging Operator which uses openshift-logging:cluster-logging service account

# IAM Policy for CloudWatch Logging
# Grants permissions to create log groups, log streams, and write log events to CloudWatch
